## Description

This repository demonstrates a basic implementation of loading and displaying an image using the OpenCV library in Python.

### Files Structure

- **Files/images.py**: A Python script that loads an image using the OpenCV Python library and displays it in a window. The script is simple and checks whether the image is successfully loaded before displaying it.
  
- **Images/**: Contains sample images used by the `images.py` script.

### Images
The Images folder contains two sample images:
- **image1.jpg**: A sample image.
- **image2.jpg**: Another sample image.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/computer-vision.git
